**Problem**
I am designing a 2D lifting mechanism inside a 150 cm long by 50 cm tall design space.  
The goal is to use a linear actuator and three pin supports to lift a weight as high
as possible while staying within the given geometric and support constraints.

**Constraints**
- Design space: 150 cm long, 50 cm tall.
- Exactly three pin supports; two must be mounted on the ground.
- One linear actuator selected from the course catalog  
  (fixed stroke length and maximum force).
- All supports, links, and the actuator are treated as rigid.
- Mechanism must operate within the given space without interference.

**Objectives**
- Maximize the maximum weight that can be lifted to the highest possible height.
- Keep the mechanism simple and mechanically realistic.
- Use the actuator effectively (good leverage, reasonable angles).

**Design Degrees of Freedom**
Treating the main bar and links as rigid, the mechanism has **1 degree of freedom**:
the extension of the linear actuator. Changing the actuator length controls the
rotation of the bar and therefore the vertical position of the lifted weight.
