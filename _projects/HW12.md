### <ins>Part 1</ins>
### a)
#### <ins>Problem</ins>
I am designing a 2D lifting mechanism inside a 150 cm long by 50 cm tall design space.  
The goal is to use a linear actuator and three pin supports to lift a weight as high
as possible while staying within the given geometric and support constraints.

#### <ins>Constraints</ins>
- Design space: 150 cm long, 50 cm tall.
- Exactly three pin supports; two must be mounted on the ground.
- One linear actuator selected from the course catalog  
  (fixed stroke length and maximum force).
- All supports, links, and the actuator are treated as rigid.
- Mechanism must operate within the given space without interference.

#### <ins>Objectives</ins>
- Maximize the maximum weight that can be lifted to the highest possible height.
- Keep the mechanism simple and mechanically realistic.
- Use the actuator effectively (good leverage, reasonable angles).

#### <ins>Design Degrees of Freedom</ins>
Treating the main bar and links as rigid, the mechanism has **1 degree of freedom**:
the extension of the linear actuator. Changing the actuator length controls the
rotation of the bar and therefore the vertical position of the lifted weight.

### b)

#### <ins>Static Analysis</ins>

From the law of cosines applied to the triangle formed by the actuator and bar:

- cos(θ₁) = 0.942 → sin(θ₁) ≈ 0.334  
- cos(θ₂) = 0.497 → sin(θ₂) ≈ 0.866  

Vertical height change of the bar tip:

Δh = L(sinθ₂ − sinθ₁)

Using L = 50 cm:

Δh = 50(0.866 − 0.334) = 84.1 cm

Total height reached:

h_max = 50 + 84.1 = **134.1 cm**

#### <ins>Force Analysis in the Extended Position</ins>

At maximum extension, the actuator provides **36 kN** of force at approximately **60°** relative to the bar.

Resolving the actuator force into the vertical direction:

W = 36 kN / cos(60°)

cos(60°) = 0.5

So:

W = 36 / 0.5 = **72 kN**

Thus, under rigid-body assumptions, the mechanism can lift **up to 72 kN** in the extended configuration.

### <ins>Part 2</ins>
### a) 

#### Maximum Deflection in the Beam

We now treat the bar as a flexible beam. Two vertical loads act on it:
1. The lifted weight at the tip (40 kN)
2. The actuator's vertical force component (36 kN) located 1.0 m from the fixed support

Assumptions:
- Beam length: 1.50 m
- Material: Steel (E = 200 GPa)
- Cross-section (initial): solid rectangle 100 mm × 50 mm
- Second moment of area: I = 4.17 × 10⁻⁶ m⁴
- Tip load: 40 kN
- Actuator load: 36 kN at 1.0 m

Deflection formulas:
- Tip load: δ = (P * L³) / (3EI)
- Point load at distance a: δ = (P * a² * (3L - a)) / (6EI)

Tip load deflection:
≈ 54 mm

Actuator load deflection:
≈ 25 mm

Total deflection:
≈ 80 mm

The beam does not meet the stiffness requirement.

### b) 

#### Beam Redesign (2% Deflection Limit)

Allowable deflection = 0.02 × 1.5 m = 30 mm.

To reduce deflection, choose a thin-walled rectangular hollow section (RHS), which increases stiffness while reducing mass.

Selected section:
- 200 mm × 80 mm × 5 mm wall
- Second moment of area: approx. 2.0 × 10⁻⁵ m⁴

New deflection:
≈ 17 mm

Since 17 mm < 30 mm, the new beam design satisfies the requirement.
