### a)
#### <ins>Problem</ins>
I am designing a 2D lifting mechanism inside a 150 cm long by 50 cm tall design space.  
The goal is to use a linear actuator and three pin supports to lift a weight as high
as possible while staying within the given geometric and support constraints.

#### <ins>Constraints</ins>
- Design space: 150 cm long, 50 cm tall.
- Exactly three pin supports; two must be mounted on the ground.
- One linear actuator selected from the course catalog  
  (fixed stroke length and maximum force).
- All supports, links, and the actuator are treated as rigid.
- Mechanism must operate within the given space without interference.

#### <ins>Objectives</ins>
- Maximize the maximum weight that can be lifted to the highest possible height.
- Keep the mechanism simple and mechanically realistic.
- Use the actuator effectively (good leverage, reasonable angles).

#### <ins>Design Degrees of Freedom</ins>
Treating the main bar and links as rigid, the mechanism has **1 degree of freedom**:
the extension of the linear actuator. Changing the actuator length controls the
rotation of the bar and therefore the vertical position of the lifted weight.

### b)

#### <ins>Static Analysis</ins>

From the law of cosines applied to the triangle formed by the actuator and bar:

- cos(θ₁) = 0.942 → sin(θ₁) ≈ 0.334  
- cos(θ₂) = 0.497 → sin(θ₂) ≈ 0.866  

Vertical height change of the bar tip:

Δh = L(sinθ₂ − sinθ₁)

Using L = 50 cm:

Δh = 50(0.866 − 0.334) = 84.1 cm

Total height reached:

h_max = 50 + 84.1 = **134.1 cm**

#### <ins>Force Analysis in the Extended Position</ins>

At maximum extension, the actuator provides **36 kN** of force at approximately **60°** relative to the bar.

Resolving the actuator force into the vertical direction:

W = 36 kN / cos(60°)

cos(60°) = 0.5

So:

W = 36 / 0.5 = **72 kN**

Thus, under rigid-body assumptions, the mechanism can lift **up to 72 kN** in the extended configuration.
