## a) Problem Definition

I am designing a 2D lifting mechanism inside a 150 cm long by 50 cm tall design space.  
The goal is to use a linear actuator and three pin supports to lift a weight as high as possible while staying within the geometric and support constraints.

### **Constraints**
- Design space: 150 cm long, 50 cm tall  
- Exactly three pin supports; two must be mounted on the ground  
- One linear actuator selected from the course catalog (fixed stroke length and max force)  
- All supports, links, and the actuator are treated as rigid  
- Mechanism must operate within the given space without interference

### **Objectives**
- Maximize lifting height  
- Keep the mechanism simple and realistic  
- Use the actuator effectively (good leverage, reasonable angles)

### **Degrees of Freedom**
The system has **1 degree of freedom**: the extension of the actuator.  
Changing the actuator length rotates the bar and moves the lifted weight vertically.

---

## b) Static Analysis

### **Angle calculations from law of cosines**
- cos(θ₁) = 0.942 → sin(θ₁) ≈ 0.334  
- cos(θ₂) = 0.497 → sin(θ₂) ≈ 0.866  

### **Vertical height change**
Δh = L(sinθ₂ − sinθ₁)

Using L = 50 cm:

Δh = 50(0.866 − 0.334) = **84.1 cm**

### **Total reachable height**
h_max = 50 + 84.1 = **134.1 cm**

---

## **Force Analysis (Extended Position)**

At maximum extension, the actuator applies **36 kN** at approximately **60°** relative to the bar.

Resolving into the vertical direction:

cos(60°) = 0.5  
W = 36 kN / 0.5 = **72 kN**

**Thus, the mechanism can lift up to 72 kN under rigid-body assumptions.**

## a) Maximum Deflection in the Beam

Now the bar is treated as a flexible beam rather than a rigid link.

### **Geometry and Loads**
- Beam length: L = 50√10 cm ≈ 1.58 m  
- Actuator attachment point: midpoint → a = 0.79 m  
- Material: structural steel (E = 200 GPa)  
- Initial cross-section: 100 mm × 50 mm rectangle  
- Second moment of area:
  - I = (b·h³)/12 = 4.17×10⁻⁶ m⁴  
- Loads considered:
  - Tip load (weight): 36 kN  
  - Actuator force: 36 kN

### **Assumptions**
Euler–Bernoulli beam theory with small deflections is assumed. Material is linear-elastic and the section is prismatic. 
Loads are static and perpendicular to the beam. The fixed support is ideal, and superposition is valid, allowing the 
free-end deflections from individual loads to be added.

---

### **Deflection Formulas**

1. Tip load:  
   δ_tip = (-P_tip · L³) / (3 E I)

2. Point load at distance a:  
   δ_act = (P_act · a² · (3L − a)) / (6 E I)

---

### **Numerical Calculation**

Using:
- L = 1.58 m  
- a = 0.79 m  
- E = 200×10⁹ Pa  
- I = 4.17×10⁻⁶ m⁴  
- P_tip = 36,000 N  
- P_act = -36,000 N  

Results:
- Tip-load deflection: **-56.9 mm**  
- Actuator-load deflection: **-17.8 mm**  
- Total deflection: **-74.7 mm**

---

## b) Beam Redesign Using I-Beams

Maximum total deflection: 0.02L = 0.0316 m

I_required = 2.5 × 4.17×10⁻⁶ = **23.6 in⁴**

### Selecting a Standard W-Shape

| Beam | Ix (in⁴) | A (in²) |
|------|----------|---------|
| **W5×21** | 26.3 | 5.56 |

Since:

26.3in⁴ > 23.6 in⁴ and has the least area out of all the beams with the minimum Ix

→ **W5×21 easily satisfies the requirement.**

---

## c) Final Beam Design

The material, mechanism geometry, and attachment points remain unchanged.  
Only the bar shape is replaced with a **W5×21 designed beam** to meet stiffness requirements.
