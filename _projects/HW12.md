### <ins>Part 1</ins>
### a)
#### <ins>Problem</ins>
I am designing a 2D lifting mechanism inside a 150 cm long by 50 cm tall design space.  
The goal is to use a linear actuator and three pin supports to lift a weight as high
as possible while staying within the given geometric and support constraints.

#### <ins>Constraints</ins>
- Design space: 150 cm long, 50 cm tall.
- Exactly three pin supports; two must be mounted on the ground.
- One linear actuator selected from the course catalog  
  (fixed stroke length and maximum force).
- All supports, links, and the actuator are treated as rigid.
- Mechanism must operate within the given space without interference.

#### <ins>Objectives</ins>
- Maximize the maximum weight that can be lifted to the highest possible height.
- Keep the mechanism simple and mechanically realistic.
- Use the actuator effectively (good leverage, reasonable angles).

#### <ins>Design Degrees of Freedom</ins>
Treating the main bar and links as rigid, the mechanism has **1 degree of freedom**:
the extension of the linear actuator. Changing the actuator length controls the
rotation of the bar and therefore the vertical position of the lifted weight.

### b)

#### <ins>Static Analysis</ins>

From the law of cosines applied to the triangle formed by the actuator and bar:

- cos(θ₁) = 0.942 → sin(θ₁) ≈ 0.334  
- cos(θ₂) = 0.497 → sin(θ₂) ≈ 0.866  

Vertical height change of the bar tip:

Δh = L(sinθ₂ − sinθ₁)

Using L = 50 cm:

Δh = 50(0.866 − 0.334) = 84.1 cm

Total height reached:

h_max = 50 + 84.1 = **134.1 cm**

#### <ins>Force Analysis in the Extended Position</ins>

At maximum extension, the actuator provides **36 kN** of force at approximately **60°** relative to the bar.

Resolving the actuator force into the vertical direction:

W = 36 kN / cos(60°)

cos(60°) = 0.5

So:

W = 36 / 0.5 = **72 kN**

Thus, under rigid-body assumptions, the mechanism can lift **up to 72 kN** in the extended configuration.

### <ins>Part 2</ins>

### a) Maximum Deflection in the Beam

Now the bar is treated as a flexible beam instead of a rigid link.

---

### **Geometry and Loads**

- **Beam span:**  
  L = 50√10 cm ≈ 1.58 m  
- **Actuator attachment point:**  
  At the midpoint → a = L/2 = 0.79 m  
- **Material:** Structural steel  
  E = 200 GPa = 200 × 10⁹ Pa  
- **Initial cross-section guess:**  
  Solid rectangle, 100 mm × 50 mm  
- **Second moment of area:**  
  I = (b × h³) / 12  
  = (0.05 × 0.10³) / 12  
  = 4.17 × 10⁻⁶ m⁴  
- **Vertical loads considered:**  
  • Tip load (weight): **40 kN**  
  • Actuator vertical force at C: **36 kN**

---

### **Deflection Formulas (Simply Supported Beam)**

1. **Tip load at the end of the span:**  
   δ_tip = (P_tip × L³) / (3 × E × I)

2. **Point load at distance a from the left support:**  
   δ_act = (P_act × a² × (3L – a)) / (6 × E × I)

---

### **Numerical Calculations**

Using  
L = 1.58 m  
a = 0.79 m  
E = 200 × 10⁹ Pa  
I = 4.17 × 10⁻⁶ m⁴  
P_tip = 40,000 N  
P_act = 36,000 N  

- **Tip-load deflection:**  
  δ_tip ≈ 0.054 m = **54 mm**

- **Actuator-load deflection:**  
  δ_act ≈ 0.025 m = **25 mm**

- **Total vertical deflection (superposition):**  
  δ_total ≈ 54 mm + 25 mm = **80 mm**

---

## b) Beam Design Using Standard W-Shapes

From Part (a), the required stiffness is:

- Maximum allowed deflection: 2% of L  
  → 0.02 × 1.58 m = **32 mm**
- Actual deflection from Part (a): **80 mm**

Therefore, the beam needs to be:

Required stiffness increase = 80 / 32 ≈ **2.5×

Since stiffness ∝ I (second moment of area),  
we need:  

I_required = 2.5 × I_current  
I_required = 2.5 × (4.17 × 10⁻⁶ m⁴)  
I_required ≈ **1.04 × 10⁻⁵ m⁴**

---

### Selecting a Standard W-Shape

Using the AISC table (shown above):

| Beam | I<sub>x</sub> (in⁴) | I<sub>x</sub> (m⁴) |
|------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **W8×21** | 75.3 in⁴ | 3.13 × 10⁻⁵ m⁴ |

Conversion used:  
1 in⁴ = 4.162 × 10⁻⁷ m⁴  
75.3 in⁴ × 4.162×10⁻⁷ = **3.13 × 10⁻⁵ m⁴**

This satisfies the requirement:

- Required: 1.04 × 10⁻⁵ m⁴  
- W8×21: 3.13 × 10⁻⁵ m⁴ (**greater**)

---

### Updated Deflection Check

New deflection:

δ_new = δ_old × (I_old / I_new)

= 80 mm × (4.17e-6 / 3.13e-5)  
≈ **10.7 mm**

This is **below 32 mm**, so the W8×21 beam *comfortably* meets the stiffness requirement.

---

### Why W8×21 Is the Most Efficient Option

- High bending stiffness (I<sub>x</sub> = 75.3 in⁴)  
- Low weight (21 lb/ft = 31 kg/m)  
- Much more efficient than a rectangular solid section  
- Standard, easy to source, and strong in the major axis bending case

**Conclusion:**  
The **W8×21** is the most mass-efficient beam meeting the deflection requirement.

## c) Final Beam Design

The original mechanism layout remains the same — the actuator and supports stay in their original positions.  
The only change is replacing the bar with a **W8×21 wide-flange steel beam**, which satisfies the stiffness requirement from Part (b).

### Selected Beam Cross-Section: W8×21

**Beam properties (AISC W8×21):**

- Depth: **8.28 in**
- Flange width: **5.27 in**
- Flange thickness: **0.40 in**
- Web thickness: **0.25 in**
- Moment of inertia: **\(I_x = 75.3 \, \text{in}^4\)**

This beam provides adequate stiffness while minimizing weight and integrates directly into the mechanism without changing any attachment points.
