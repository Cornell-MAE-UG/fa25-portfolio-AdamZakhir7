## a) Problem Definition

I am designing a 2D lifting mechanism inside a 150 cm long by 50 cm tall design space.  
The goal is to use a linear actuator and three pin supports to lift a weight as high as possible while staying within the geometric and support constraints.

### **Constraints**
- Design space: 150 cm long, 50 cm tall  
- Exactly three pin supports; two must be mounted on the ground  
- One linear actuator selected from the course catalog (fixed stroke length and max force)  
- All supports, links, and the actuator are treated as rigid  
- Mechanism must operate within the given space without interference

### **Objectives**
- Maximize lifting height  
- Keep the mechanism simple and realistic  
- Use the actuator effectively (good leverage, reasonable angles)

### **Degrees of Freedom**
The system has **1 degree of freedom**: the extension of the actuator.  
Changing the actuator length rotates the bar and moves the lifted weight vertically.

---

## b) Static Analysis

### **Angle calculations from law of cosines**
- cos(θ₁) = 0.942 → sin(θ₁) ≈ 0.334  
- cos(θ₂) = 0.497 → sin(θ₂) ≈ 0.866  

### **Vertical height change**
Δh = L(sinθ₂ − sinθ₁)

Using L = 50 cm:

Δh = 50(0.866 − 0.334) = **84.1 cm**

### **Total reachable height**
h_max = 50 + 84.1 = **134.1 cm**

---

## **Force Analysis (Extended Position)**

At maximum extension, the actuator applies **36 kN** at approximately **60°** relative to the bar.

Resolving into the vertical direction:

cos(60°) = 0.5  
W = 36 kN / 0.5 = **72 kN**

**Thus, the mechanism can lift up to 72 kN under rigid-body assumptions.**

## a) Maximum Deflection in the Beam

Now the bar is treated as a flexible beam rather than a rigid link.

### **Geometry and Loads**
- Beam length: L = 50√10 cm ≈ 1.58 m  
- Actuator attachment point: midpoint → a = 0.79 m  
- Material: structural steel (E = 200 GPa)  
- Initial cross-section: 100 mm × 50 mm rectangle  
- Second moment of area:
  - I = (b·h³)/12 = 4.17×10⁻⁶ m⁴  
- Loads considered:
  - Tip load (weight): 40 kN  
  - Actuator vertical component: 36 kN  

---

### **Deflection Formulas (Simply Supported Beam)**

1. Tip load:  
   δ_tip = (P_tip · L³) / (3 E I)

2. Point load at distance a:  
   δ_act = (P_act · a² · (3L − a)) / (6 E I)

---

### **Numerical Calculation**

Using:
- L = 1.58 m  
- a = 0.79 m  
- E = 200×10⁹ Pa  
- I = 4.17×10⁻⁶ m⁴  
- P_tip = 40,000 N  
- P_act = 36,000 N  

Results:
- Tip-load deflection: **54 mm**  
- Actuator-load deflection: **25 mm**  
- Total deflection: **80 mm**

Because the maximum allowable deflection is:

0.02 × 1.58 m = **32 mm**

→ The beam **fails** the stiffness requirement.

---

## b) Beam Redesign Using W-Shapes

Required stiffness factor:

80 mm / 32 mm = **2.5× stiffer**

I_required = 2.5 × 4.17×10⁻⁶ = **1.04×10⁻⁵ m⁴**

### Selecting a Standard W-Shape

| Beam | Ix (in⁴) | Ix (m⁴) |
|------|----------|---------|
| **W8×21** | 75.3 | 3.13×10⁻⁵ |

(1 in⁴ = 4.162×10⁻⁷ m⁴)

Since:

3.13×10⁻⁵ m⁴ > 1.04×10⁻⁵ m⁴  

→ **W8×21 easily satisfies the requirement.**

### Updated Deflection
δ_new = 80 mm × (4.17×10⁻⁶ / 3.13×10⁻⁵)  
δ_new ≈ **10.7 mm**

### Why W8×21 Is the Best Choice
- High bending stiffness  
- Lightweight for its stiffness  
- Standard structural member  
- More efficient than a solid rectangular bar  

---

## c) Final Beam Design

The mechanism geometry and attachment points remain unchanged.  
Only the bar is replaced with a **W8×21 steel beam** to meet stiffness requirements.

### Beam Cross-Section (W8×21)

### Beam Properties
- Depth: 8.28 in  
- Flange width: 5.27 in  
- Flange thickness: 0.40 in  
- Web thickness: 0.25 in  
- Ix = 75.3 in⁴  

This beam provides more than enough stiffness (deflection reduced to 10.7 mm) while keeping the mechanism lightweight and structurally efficient.
